# nProFit_mod 
_mod README
I modified the repo nProFit  just for running test on different architecture machines (the original repo runs on macOS
and with little changes also on Debian11 (64 bit) or of course any other Linux distro)
I'm not already sure if my work is right.
So please do not trust in this repo, see the repo nProFit instead!!!
